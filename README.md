## Coding Lab - Blog App

This is a RESTful API designed with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. The goal of the app is to test other ways to set a secure app with authentication without using [express-sessions](https://github.com/expressjs/session) or [PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org/). The UI can improve but is not the main point that brought up me build this app.

### Getting Started
